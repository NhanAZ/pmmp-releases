This was causing entire regions to be discarded next time they were freshly loaded.\r\n- Fixed performance issue loading old LevelDB worlds (from before MCPE 1.0) due to unmodified chunks being converted every time they were loaded.\r\n- Added new debug messages when a world takes too long (longer than 50ms) to complete a tick.\r\n- Debug messages are now logged when autosave kicks in (with time measurements), which helps debugging unexplained lag spikes.\r\n- Level \"auto tick rate\" anti-feature and its associated `pocketmine.yml` settings have been removed (see #2665). The settings will persist in old configurations, but will be ignored by this version and future versions.\r\n- The `/save-all` command now outputs custom (non-vanilla) messages informing the user how long it took to complete autosaving.\r\n- The word `level` has been replaced with `world` (where appropriate) throughout language strings and general user interface messages.",

(MOJANG!!!)\r\n- Placement of unknown blocks is now disallowed. This solves a range of problems with invalid blocks in the world, such as #2260 .\r\n- Errors thrown during `PlayerQuitEvent` or other `Player->close()` errors will now crash the server instead of causing cryptic bugs later on.\r\n- Fixed large chunks (>= 1044476 bytes) becoming corrupted when saved in Region-based worlds - now an exception is thrown instead.\r\n- Reduced the range of exceptions caught during chunk loading. Now, only chunk corruption errors are caught, and anything else will produce a crash.\r\n- Removed catch-all block on chunk saving. Unexpected errors thrown during chunk save will now create a crash.\r\n- Fixed some asserts in packet decode methods.\r\n- `Attribute` now throws exceptions with more informative messages on errors.\r\n- Properly handled some remaining `Uninitialized string offset` bugs when decoding packets.\r\n- Fixed chunk updates taking several seconds to show up on the client. This bug was most apparent during generation and some world editing tools using asynchronous tasks.\r\n- Fixed CPU waste ordering chunks for non-moving players.",

    "body": "**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.7.0**\r\n\r\nThis is a cumulative minor release featuring performance improvements, memory usage improvements, some new minor gameplay features, some API deprecations and additions, and significant changes to error handling.\r\n\r\n### Note\r\nPlugins compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on this build and do not need API bumps.\r\n\r\nHowever, some API features have been deprecated in this version. Plugin developers do not need to do anything about these deprecations immediately, however they may raise harmless warnings if used.\r\n\r\nFeatures marked **`@deprecated`** are **recommended** not to be used, but will continue to work for any future 3.x.y versions. They will be removed in the next major release (4.0).\r\n\r\n## Core changes\r\n### Performance & memory improvements\r\n- Entity `EXHAUSTION` attribute is no longer synced to the client, which reduces network traffic for survival players and reduces client-sided lag.\r\n- A redundant call was removed from an `Event` call hot path which improves event calling performance by ~15% per event handler executed.\r\n- Light updates are now batched together and executed on the end of each tick. The effects of this are noticeable when setting a large number of blocks in a close area - significant performance improvements should be noticeable for world editors (the ones that didn't disable light updates) and liquid flow is now significantly less expensive.\r\n- Internal enhancements have been made to subchunk light array interfacing to reduce branching and improve access performance.\r\n- Memory usage of most chunks has dropped by ~30-40% due to some improvements to internal storage of unlit subchunks. In real terms this translates to ~30% memory usage reduction for a freshly generated world.\r\n\r\n### Error handling\r\nThe most notable core change in this release revolves around error handling. Internals have been cleaned up substantially to improve the server behaviour under occurrence of unexpected behaviour. The goal of this is to improve consistency and quality while reducing undefined runtime behaviour.\r\nThe following changes have been made:\r\n- Throwing **unexpected** `Throwable`s in the following cases will now cause a server crash (except on network (this will be changed in the future)):\r\n  - Event handlers\r\n  - `Task->onRun()` on a scheduler\r\n  - `AsyncTask->onCompletion()`\r\n  - `Command->execute()` and `CommandExecutor->onCommand()`\r\n- Unexpected `Throwable`s thrown during packet handling will now cause the target player to be disconnected with an `Internal server error` message.\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n- Anti-flight has been removed, along with the `allow-flight` directive in `server.properties`.\r\n- Server language is now controlled by the `language` directive in `server.properties`.\r\n- Added `unban` and `unban-ip` as aliases of `pardon` and `pardon-ip` commands respectively.\r\n\r\n## API changes\r\n### Block\r\n- `BlockSpreadEvent` is now fired when lava or water tries to flow into a block.\r\n- `BlockFormEvent` is now fired when lava and water collide to form cobblestone, obsidian or stone.\r\n\r\n### Event\r\n- Added new method `Event->call()`. This should be used instead of `PluginManager->callEvent()` in plugins only supporting 3.4+.\r\n- `PluginManager->callEvent()` has been `@deprecated`.\r\n\r\n### Level\r\n- Attempting to unload a level during its tick will now throw an `InvalidStateException`.\r\n- Added the following new methods:\r\n  - `Level->broadcastPacketToViewers()`\r\n  - `Level->getViewersForPosition()`\r\n  - `Level->broadcastGlobalPacket()`\r\n  - `Level->getChunkAtPosition()`\r\n  - `Level->isInLoadedTerrain()`\r\n- `Level->addGlobalPacket()` has been `@deprecated`.\r\n- `LightUpdate` now allows calling `setAndUpdateLight()` for the same position multiple times (needed for light update batching).\r\n\r\n### Permission\r\n- `Permission::getByName()` now throws an exception on invalid values instead of silently returning `DEFAULT_FALSE`. This may cause new errors to appear if your plugins had broken permission defaults in `plugin.yml`.\r\n\r\n### Player\r\n- `addWindow()` now has stricter validity checks and will now throw exceptions in the following cases: No window IDs left to use, and when a forced window ID collides with an existing window.\r\n- The public `$speed` field has been removed (this was only used by anti-cheat which has now been removed).\r\n\r\n### Scheduler\r\n- `AsyncTask->setResult()` has had the `$serialize` parameter removed - now it will automatically serialize (or not) as appropriate.\r\n- Added a new `ClosureTask` which allows concisely scheduling closure execution on a `TaskScheduler`.\r\n- `TaskScheduler->__construct()` `$logger` parameter has been `@deprecated` and will be removed in a future major version.\r\n\r\n### Server\r\n- Added new method `Server->hasOfflinePlayerData(string $name) : bool`.\r\n- `Server->getAllowFlight()` has been `@deprecated`.\r\n\r\n### Utils\r\n- `Config->save()` will no longer catch unexpected exceptions thrown while encoding data.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay changes\r\n### Blocks\r\n- Rail connectivity has been implemented for normal, powered, detector and activator rails (but there are currently no minecarts).",

    "body": "**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.6.0**\r\n\r\nThis is a new minor feature release, including support for Minecraft Bedrock 1.6.0, some new minor gameplay features and some API deprecations and additions.\r\n\r\n### Note\r\nPlugins compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on this build and do not need API bumps.\r\n\r\nHowever, some API features have been deprecated in this version. Plugin developers do not need to do anything about these deprecations immediately, however they may raise harmless warnings if used.\r\n\r\nFeatures marked **`@deprecated`** are **recommended** not to be used, but will continue to work for any future 3.x.y versions. They will be removed in the next major release (4.0).\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n### Core\r\n- `Level` generators are now registered only when needed instead of as soon as a worker starts. This drastically reduces memory consumption on servers with lots of workers.\r\n- Async workers are now garbage-collected along with everything else on the default schedule. Idle workers with 0 queued tasks will be shutdown and removed from the pool to reduce memory usage.\r\n- UPnP error messages are now more informative of troubleshooting steps.\r\n- Errors are no longer caught in cases where they are unrecoverable.\r\n\r\n### API\r\n#### Entity\r\n- Arrow pickup mode can now be controlled via `Arrow->setPickupMode()`. This accepts one of three `Arrow` constants: `PICKUP_NONE`, `PICKUP_ANY`, `PICKUP_CREATIVE`.\r\n- Added new API methods `Projectile->getBaseDamage()` and `Projectile->setBaseDamage()`.\r\n- Added new API methods `Entity->getScoreTag()` and `Entity->setScoreTag()`.\r\n\r\n#### Events\r\n- The `Listener` interface has now received in-depth documentation about its behaviour and uses. See the top of the `Listener` class to read it.\r\n- It is now possible to declare `@ignoreCancelled` on an event handler without specifying `true` or `false`. If no value is found, `true` will be assumed.\r\n- `ServerCommandEvent` and `RemoteServerCommandEvent` are now **`@deprecated`** and their usage discouraged. A new generic `CommandEvent` has been introduced in its place, which allows capturing commands from any type of command sender. This was done in response to difficulties of code duplication when wanting to intercept commands from both console and players.\r\n- `EntityDamageEvent`\r\n  - Added `MODIFIER_WEAPON_ENCHANTMENTS` constant for attack damage bonuses due to enchantments like Sharpness.\r\n  - Added new API methods `getAttackCooldown()` and `setAttackCooldown()` to allow controlling Living entities attack cooldown times (default 10 ticks).\r\n- `PlayerDeathEvent`: Added new static method `deriveMessage()`.\r\n- `PlayerKickEvent`: Added new method `setReason()`.\r\n\r\n#### Forms\r\n- Added a new `pocketmine\\form\\Form` interface. Implementing this interface permits custom form implementations to make use of `Player->sendForm()`, eliminating the need to handle packets directly and also solving the form ID collision problem.\r\n\r\n#### Items\r\n- `Item` and `ItemFactory` now support negative item IDs (needed for future extended blocks support).\r\n- Updated `ItemIds` interface with new constants.\r\n\r\n#### Permission\r\n- Added a new `PermissionManager` class which encapsulates all of the permission-management functionality originally bloating `PluginManager`. The API is identical to that of `PluginManager`'s permission API. All methods moved to `PermissionManager` have **`@deprecated`** redirects remaining behind in `PluginManager`, which will be removed in the next major release (4.0).\r\n\r\n#### Plugin\r\n- `PluginBase->getConfig()` will now automatically save the default config if it does not already exist.\r\n- Plugin data directories will now be automatically created on plugin load, eliminating the need for boilerplate `@mkdir($this->getDataFolder())` calls at the top of every plugin.\r\n\r\n#### Tile\r\n- `Tile::createNBT()` will now throw a `BadMethodCallException` when called directly.\r\n\r\n#### Utils\r\n- `Utils::getURL()`, `Utils::postURL()`, `Utils::simpleCurl()` and `Utils::getIP()` have been moved to a new `pocketmine\\utils\\Internet` class. The original methods are **`@deprecated`** and will be removed for the next major version (4.0).\r\n- Removed the ability for `Config` to be asynchronously saved. This was discussed for removal because of various problems that it causes. It was deemed not worth fixing since `Config` saving should not be significant enough to cause problems anyway. See #2298 for details.\r\n\r\n#### Server\r\n- Deprecated `level` parameter of `findEntity()`. This parameter was premature optimization. Code using it will continue to work as before.\r\n\r\n### Gameplay\r\n#### General\r\n- Air bubbles are now regenerated at the same speed as vanilla UpdateAquatic, instead of instantly when leaving water.\r\n- Implemented Conduit Power effect.\r\n\r\n#### Enchantments\r\n- Implemented the following enchantments: Thorns, Sharpness, Knockback, Fire Aspect, Power, Punch, Flame, Infinity, Mending.\r\n\r\n#### Items\r\n- Added the following new items: `Scute`",

This now reports directly to the timings host instead of using Ubuntu Pastebin.\r\n- Minor code cleanups in various places.\r\n- Zip resource packs will now give slightly less useless errors - errors for broken manifest have been separated from those with fields missing, and now reports why decoding failed if it failed.",

    "body": "**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.4.0**\r\n\r\nPlugin scheduler rewrite, RCON rewrite, performance improvements, improved idle memory usage\r\n\r\n**While this release is nominally not an alpha, it is still not feature complete and does not include all gameplay features. Please do not create issues for missing gameplay features.**\r\n\r\nThis build has breaking API changes.\r\nThis release is the first to use the new merged versioning system. The PocketMine-MP version and the API version are now one and the same.\r\n\r\nPlease use our issue tracker to report bugs.\r\n\r\n# Notable changes\r\n## Core\r\n<details><summary>General</summary>\r\n\r\n- This release introduces a new dependency library called `Snooze`, which PocketMine-MP utilizes for managing notifications between threads. This library is currently utilized by command reading, RCON and RakLib, allowing faster response times to commands, reduced network latency, and better performance due to lack of need for polling.\r\n- Fixed race condition causing `ServerKiller` to sometimes kill the server for no reason on shutdown.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Dependency libraries</summary>\r\n\r\nRequires the following libraries:\r\n- [`pocketmine/raklib` `^0.12.0`](https://github.com/pmmp/RakLib/releases/0.12.0)\r\n- [`pocketmine/spl` `^0.3.0`](https://github.com/pmmp/SPL/releases/0.3.0)\r\n- [`pocketmine/binaryutils` `^0.1.0`](https://github.com/pmmp/BinaryUtils/releases/0.1.0)\r\n- [`pocketmine/nbt` `^0.2.0`](https://github.com/pmmp/NBT/releases/0.2.0)\r\n- [`pocketmine/math` `^0.2.0`](https://github.com/pmmp/Math/releases/0.2.0)\r\n- [`pocketmine/snooze` `^0.1.0`](https://github.com/pmmp/Snooze/releases/0.1.0)\r\n\r\nThese libraries may individually have changes which are not recorded here. See their independent repository releases for their changelogs.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n \r\n<details><summary>Async pooling</summary>\r\n\r\n- Async workers are now started dynamically when they are needed only, instead of being started immediately on startup. This allows reducing idle memory usage.\r\n- AsyncPool now appropriately shuts down the workers when instructed to, instead of leaving it up to the ThreadManager to clean it up. This eliminates debug messages of shutting down async workers on server shutdown.\r\n- Default maximum async worker memory limit has been lowered from 1024MB to 256MB.\r\n- Async workers are now started using the options `PTHREADS_INHERIT_CONSTANTS | PTHREADS_INHERIT_INI`, which reduces idle memory wastage and works around some bugs in pthreads.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Entities</summary>\r\n\r\n- Fixed entities not being despawned when flagged, if they weren't scheduled for an update.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Levels</summary>\r\n\r\n- Seed handling is now always consistent between `pocketmine.yml` and `server.properties`.\r\n- Fixed generation bugs in imported LevelDB worlds where the classpath was saved into level.dat.\r\n- Generators for levels are no longer created on the main thread, reducing memory usage.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Plugins</summary>\r\n\r\n- Plugin data is now stored under `<data dir>/plugin_data` by default on new installations, instead of in `<plugins dir>`. This behaviour does not affect existing installations by default - if you want to enable it, set `plugins.legacy-data-dir` to `false` in `pocketmine.yml`.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>RCON</summary>\r\n\r\nRCON has been almost completely rewritten in this release.\r\n- Now event-driven (using Snooze) instead of poll-based, improving performance.\r\n- Fixed segmentation fault when stopping the server with RCON enabled.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## API\r\n**WARNING: Dependency library API changes are not listed here. See their individual release notes for changes (linked above in the Core section).**\r\n\r\n<details><summary>API versioning changes for plugins</summary>\r\n\r\nThe way that the API versioning is done has changed. Now the API version is synonymous with the PocketMine-MP version.\r\nPlugin compatibility is determined by the following:\r\n- Take the base version, and strip any metadata (everything after the `+` sign, for example `3.0.0+dev.1191` becomes `3.0.0`).\r\n- Assert that:\r\n  - The major versions is the same\r\n  - The server's minor version is greater than or equal to the plugin's\r\n  - The server's patch version is greater than or equal to the plugin's\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no support for locking version by metadata, although this could be implemented if it is a wanted feature.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>General</summary>\r\n\r\n- `Server->getCodename()` and `\\pocketmine\\CODENAME` have been removed.\r\n- Added API method `Server->getTickSleeper()`, which returns a `\\pocketmine\\snooze\\SleeperHandler` instance.\r\n- `Server->getIp()` now returns `0.0.0.0` if not set.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Block</summary>\r\n\r\n- Added `Block->getXpDropForTool()`.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Entities</summary>\r\n\r\n- Calling `scheduleUpdate()` on an `Entity` after it has been `close()`d will now cause an exception to be thrown.\r\n- `Entity->motionX`, `Entity->motionY` `Entity->motionZ` have been removed in favour of an `Entity->motion` `Vector3` field. This also applies for the `lastMotion` fields.\r\n- `Entity->isInsideOfWater()` has been renamed to `isUnderwater()`.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Events</summary>\r\n\r\n- Added support for `@softDepend` annotation on event handlers, which allows the event handler to not be registered if the dependency plugin is not loaded.\r\n- Added support for `@notHandler` annotation for `Listener` methods to indicate that such methods are not event handlers.\r\n- Typehints have been applied to the events API to PHP 7.2 standards.\r\n- Fixed preventing effect expiry using `EntityEffectRemoveEvent` not being reflected on the client.\r\n- `EntityDamageEvent` API has significant changes. The general purpose of this is to split up base damage from modifiers.\r\n  - Added methods `getBaseDamage()`, `setBaseDamage()`, `getOriginalBaseDamage()`, `getModifiers()`, `getOriginalModifiers()`\r\n  - `setDamage()` renamed to `setModifier()`, and type parameter is now mandatory\r\n  - `getDamage()` renamed to `getModifier()`, and type parameter is now mandatory\r\n  - `getOriginalDamage()` renamed to `getOriginalModifier()`, and type parameter is now mandatory\r\n  - Removed `MODIFIER_BASE` constant\r\n  - Constructors now accept: `float baseDamage`, `float[] modifiers` instead of just `float[] modifiers`\r\n- Added `BlockBreakEvent->getXpDropAmount()` and `BlockBreakEvent->setXpDropAmount()`.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Inventory</summary>\r\n\r\n- `InventoryTransaction->getCreationTime()` has been removed.\r\n- `EntityInventoryChangeEvent` and `EntityArmorChangeEvent` are no longer fired during entity inventory intialization.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Item</summary>\r\n\r\n- Methods `isPickaxe()`, `isAxe()`, `isSword()`, `isShovel()`, `isHoe()`, `isShears()` have been removed. These should be replaced with `instanceof` checks for the relevant classes.\r\n- Removed `Item->useOn()`. This has been superseded by new methods used for handling durability changes.\r\n- Added hooks `Item->onDestroyBlock()` and `Item->onAttackEntity()`. These are called when a player uses the item to destroy a block or attack an entity respectively. This is used in the core code for updating durability.\r\n- `Item->pop()` now accepts an optional count parameter.\r\n- `Enchantment` now has separated primary items (which can be enchanted directly) and secondary items (which can be enchanted on an anvil). The constructor of `Enchantment` has been updated to reflect this.\r\n  - Removed `Enchantment->getSlot()` and `Enchantment->hasSlot()`.\r\n  - Added `Enchantment->getPrimaryItemFlags()`, `Enchantment->hasPrimaryItemFlag()`, `Enchantment->getSecondaryItemFlags()` and `Enchantment->hasSecondaryItemFlag()`\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Level</summary>\r\n\r\n- `Biome` classes have been moved to `pocketmine\\level\\biome` namespace. This is in preparation for future work on Levels which requires biome information (such as weather conditions).\r\n- `WeakPosition` has been removed.\r\n- Added `Level->getBiome()`.\r\n- `Level->getSafeSpawn()` now always returns a `Position` instance.\r\n- `Level->getBlockExtraData()` and `Level->setBlockExtraData()` have been removed (as well as their associated `Chunk` methods).\r\n- `ChunkManager->isInWorld()` now accepts integers instead of floats.\r\n- Added `SubChunkIteratorManager->invalidate()`.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Generator\r\n- `BiomeSelector` has been refactored to make it simpler and more robust.\r\n- Generator-management methods `registerDefaultGenerators()`, `addGenerator()`, `getGeneratorList()`, `getGenerator()`, and `getGeneratorName()` have been moved from `Generator` to a new `GeneratorManager` class.\r\n- Static noise functions in the `Generator` base class have been moved to `Noise` instance methods.\r\n- Added static method `Generator::convertSeed()`, which converts an int or string into a numeric seed for generation.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Network</summary>\r\n\r\n- `SourceInterface->process()` no longer returns a value.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Plugin</summary>\r\n\r\n- `PluginBase->getResources()` now returns an associative array where the index is the path to the resource relative to the plugin's `resources` directory.\r\n- `PluginLoader`s have been almost completely rewritten to make them simpler and more robust.\r\n  - `PluginManager->registerInterface()` does not return anything, and now accepts a `PluginLoader` instance instead of a `string`.\r\n  - `PluginLoader`:\r\n    - `getPluginFilters()`, `enablePlugin()` and `disablePlugin()` are removed. \r\n    - `loadPlugin()` responsibilities are now solely confined to doing whatever is necessary to make the plugin's classes visible by the server, and does not emit log messages or check for data directories.\r\n    - Added method `getAccessProtocol()` which determines what prefix to apply to the plugin path to access the files inside it (for example `phar://`).\r\n  - `PluginBase->init()` and `PluginBase->isInitialized()` have been removed.\r\n  - `Plugin` interface now declares a signature for the constructor which implementations must comply with.\r\n  - `Plugin` interface now declares `setEnabled()`.\r\n- It is now possible to create a custom `Plugin` implementation without requiring a custom `PluginLoader`.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Scheduler</summary>\r\n\r\nThis release features major changes to how plugin task scheduling works.\r\n- Removed `Server->getScheduler()`. All plugins now have their own scheduler which is accessible using `Plugin->getScheduler()`. Aside from being syntactically more concise and pleasant, this also allows much more effective management of tasks when plugins are disabled.\r\n- Removed `PluginTask` class, because it's now unnecessary. Previously it was required to allow the server to delete tasks associated with a plugin when the plugin was disabled. With plugin-owned schedulers, this is no longer a requirement. Plugins may now utilize the `Task` class as a base if they like.\r\n- Added `Server->getAsyncPool()`. Since the global scheduler does not exist any more, it does not manage the server's `AsyncPool` any more. Additionally, `ServerScheduler` was previously bloated by a lot of `AsyncTask` related methods, which are now not necessary because direct access to `AsyncPool` is granted instead.\r\n- `ServerScheduler`:\r\n  - `ServerScheduler` has been renamed to `TaskScheduler` since it is now a general-purpose task scheduler which is non-dependent on the user. This allows much greater flexibility and also makes it possible to unit-test.\r\n  - All `AsyncTask`/`AsyncPool` related methods have been removed - the task scheduler does not manage the async pool anymore.\r\n    - Calls to `Server->getScheduler()->scheduleAsyncTask()` should be replaced with `Server->getAsyncPool()->submitTask()`.\r\n    - Calls to `Server->getScheduler()->scheduleAsyncTaskToWorker()` should be replaced with and `Server->getAsyncPool()->submitTaskToWorker()`.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Tile</summary>\r\n\r\n- Calling `scheduleUpdate()` on a `Tile` after it has been `close()`d will now cause an exception to be thrown.\r\n- Tile NBT is now ephemeral and is not retained after creating the tile.\r\n  - `Tile->namedtag` has been removed.\r\n  - `Tile->saveNBT()` now returns a new `CompoundTag` containing saved data.\r\n  - Added new protected methods `Tile->readSaveData()` and `Tile->writeSaveData()`. These should be overridden to add or read tile-specific data, instead of overriding `saveNBT()` and `__construct()`.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Utils</summary>\r\n\r\n- Added `MainLogger->getFormat()` and `MainLogger->setFormat()` to allow manipulating console output format.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Gameplay\r\n<details><summary>General</summary>\r\n\r\n- Fixed a range of block collision issues stemming from off-by-one errors when fetching areas.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Blocks</summary>\r\n\r\n- Fixed a crash which occurred when leaving a bed which was broken and replaced during sleep.\r\n- Fixed dark oak and acacia saplings growing into oak trees - now they will not grow at all (they need to be implemented).\r\n- Saplings now take light level into account when trying to grow.\r\n- Ores and other blocks now drop experience when broken with an appropriate tool.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Entities</summary>\r\n\r\n- Fixed dropped items not being correctly destroyed by fire, cacti and other damage sources.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Generation</summary>\r\n\r\n- Grass no longer generates as the top layer of ground cover in river biomes.\r\n- Ocean biomes now use gravel instead of grass+dirt for ground cover.\r\n- Reduced maximum elevation of plains biomes to make them less bumpy.\r\n- Snow layers and other can-be-flowed-into blocks no longer generate underwater.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Items</summary>\r\n\r\n- Buckets are no longer able to delete any block by replacing it with water.\r\n- Dried Kelp, Bleach, Nautilus Shell and Heart of the Sea items are registered (although crafting recipes for these are not yet available).\r\n- Implemented `Vanishing` enchantment.\r\n- Implemented Totems.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>World</summary>\r\n\r\n- Fixed explosions sometimes leaving behind air blocks with non-zero damage values.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

    "body": "**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.2.13**\r\nEvent handler inheritance changes, crafting rewrite, gameplay additions, API changes.\r\n**This version is an alpha - it is not feature complete. Please do not create issues for missing gameplay features.**\r\n\r\nThis build has breaking API changes, so the API has been bumped to version 3.0.0-ALPHA12.\r\n\r\nPlease use our issue tracker to report bugs.\r\n\r\n# Notable changes\r\n## Core\r\n### General\r\n- `start.cmd` will now pause when the server exits with a non-zero exit code, to allow viewing any errors.\r\n- Adding ban entries with ridiculous date values is no longer permitted and will no longer crash the server on restart. This works around [a bug in the date extension in PHP](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=75992) which permits `format()` to create dates which it cannot parse.\r\n- Memory dumps are now created in a separate `memory_dumps` directory.\r\n\r\n### Commands\r\n- `/dumpmemory` no longer requires a token to create a memory dump - instead it uses the current time to identify the dump.\r\n\r\n### Network\r\n- Query packet responses are now sent only to the originating interface, not all interfaces.\r\n- Decreased on-join load by reducing size of `CraftingDataPacket`.\r\n- Fixed unhandled packet debug spam when armour items are set from the server side.\r\n\r\n### World saves\r\n- **Region-based worlds will now no longer be loaded if there are a mixture of types of region files in their `region` directory.** This would previously cause astonishing undefined behaviour which was dependent on the default level format. An error will now be emitted instead: `Cannot identify format of world`.\r\n- `Human` skins now save their skin data using `TAG_ByteArray` instead of `TAG_String`. **This is a backwards-incompatible change, earlier versions will raise errors if you have `Human` entities in your world after upgrading.**\r\n- `Human`s now save their cape data, geometry model and geometry data in their NBT.\r\n- Fixed a huge number of bugs relating to entities being saved on incorrect chunks in negative coordinates.\r\n- Fixed a bug in Region handling that caused incomplete corrupted regions to be retained and later crash the server.\r\n- Fixed chunks getting saved to disk twice on shutdown.\r\n\r\n### Player\r\n- Exploits relating to players quitting to main menu on death have been patched.\r\n- Players can no longer modify item frames or signs inside spawn protection.\r\n\r\n## Dependency libraries\r\nRequires the following libraries:\r\n- `pocketmine/binaryutils` v0.0.1\r\n- `pocketmine/math` v0.1.0\r\n- `pocketmine/nbt` v0.1.0\r\n- `pocketmine/raklib` v0.11.0\r\n- `pocketmine/spl` v0.3.0\r\n\r\n## API\r\n**WARNING: API changes to dependent libraries are not documented here. See individual library releases for notes on their changes.**\r\n\r\n### Event handler inheritance changes\r\nThis is a new major feature of this release, which makes the hierarchy of event handling much more flexible and versatile. See #1792 for details on this.\r\nHighlights:\r\n- `public static $handlerList` is no longer required in event declarations.\r\n- Any non-abstract event can have a handler registered to it - for example, you can now register handlers for both `EntityDamageEvent` (which will receive any instanceof `EntityDamageEvent`) and also be able to register a separate handler specifically for `EntityDamageByEntityEvent`.\r\n- Abstract events may be handled using the above rules if they declare the `@allowHandle` PhpDoc annotation.\r\n- Handlers will always handle all subclasses of an event. This slightly differs from existing behaviour, where handlers would only receive subclass events which did not declare their own handler lists.\r\n\r\n### Block\r\n- `Block->onUpdate()` hook has been removed, and is replaced by several new methods: `onScheduledUpdate()`, `onNearbyBlockChange()`, and `onRandomUpdate()`. The associated `Level::BLOCK_UPDATE_*` constants have been removed.\r\n\r\n### Commands\r\n- `Command->getPermissionMessage()` is now permitted to return `null`.\r\n- `ConsoleCommandSender->isPlayer()` has been removed.\r\n\r\n### Entity\r\n- `Item`, `PrimedTNT` and `FallingSand` have been moved to `object\\ItemEntity`, `object\\PrimedTNT` and `object\\FallingBlock` respectively.\r\n- Classes `entity\\object\\Painting` and `entity\\object\\PaintingMotive` have been added.\r\n- Added hook for nearby block updates: `Entity->onNearbyBlockChange()`.\r\n- Added API method `Living->hasEffects()` which returns if the entity has any active status effects.\r\n- `Effect` has been split into `Effect` (type) and `EffectInstance`. Methods relating to instance-specific things of `Effect` have been moved to `EffectInstance`. See dc3bf8546e2f700cb79adf988e15735a0c2d84fa for implementation examples.\r\n\r\n### Events\r\n- `PlayerCreationEvent->getClientId()` has been removed.\r\n- Added new events `ProjectileHitBlockEvent` and `ProjectileHitEntityEvent`.\r\n- Added new event `PlayerExperienceChangeEvent`.\r\n- Triggering a call to an event inside a handler of that event will no longer cause a segmentation fault. Instead, the maximum recursion depth for event calls has now been limited to 50 calls. Trying to go beyond this depth will cause an exception to be thrown.\r\n\r\n### Inventory\r\n- `BigCraftingGrid` has been removed. Instead, `CraftingGrid` now accepts a grid size in the constructor.\r\n- Added API method `Inventory->isSlotEmpty()`.\r\n- Optimized `BaseInventory->getContents()` method.\r\n- `DropItemAction` no longer requires a source item in the constructor (this was useless anyway).\r\n- `InventoryAction->getCreationTime()` has been removed.\r\n\r\n#### Crafting\r\nCrafting-related things have been mostly rewritten in this release and have significant changes.\r\n\r\nThe following classes have been removed:\r\n- `CraftingTransferMaterialAction`\r\n- `CraftingTakeResultAction`\r\n\r\nThe following classes have significant changes:\r\n- `CraftingManager`\r\n\t- removed the following: `getRecipe(UUID)`, `getRecipes()`\r\n\t- `matchRecipe()` now accepts `CraftingGrid, Item[]` instead of `Item[][], Item, Item[]`\r\n- `CraftingTransaction`\r\n\t- All API methods have been removed and are now handled in `CraftItemEvent`\r\n- `CraftItemEvent`\r\n\t- added the following: `getInputs()`, `getOutputs()`, `getRepetitions()`\r\n- `Recipe` interface:\r\n\t- Removed `getResult()` (because individual recipes may handle this differently)\r\n- `CraftingRecipe` interface\r\n\t- removed the following: `matchItems()`, `getExtraResults()`, `getAllResults()`, `requiresCraftingTable()`,  `getId()`, `setId()`\r\n\t- added the following: `getResultsFor(CraftingGrid)`, `getIngredientList()`, `matchesCraftingGrid(CraftingGrid)`\r\n- `ShapedRecipe`\r\n\t- constructor now accepts `string[], Item[], Item[]`\r\n- `ShapelessRecipe`\r\n\t- constructor now accepts `Item[], Item[]`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Item\r\n- `ItemFactory::init()` no longer calls `Item::initCreativeItems()`.\r\n- `ItemFactory::fromString()` now throws exceptions on failure to parse a string as a valid item ID. Previously it would silently return an Air item.\r\n- Added API method `Item->getVanillaName()`, which returns the name of an item without any custom name NBT masking it.\r\n\r\n### Language\r\n- `event\\TranslationContainer` and `event\\TextContainer` have been moved to the `lang` namespace.\r\n\r\n### Level\r\n- Added API method `Level->getRandomTickedBlocks()`.\r\n- `Explosion->__construct()` will now throw exceptions on invalid parameters.\r\n- Removed dead generator things `Level->generateChunk()`, `Level->regenerateChunk()`, `GenerationTask`.\r\n- `Level->setBlock()` now clones the `Block` object given as a parameter, fixes unexpected behaviour with setting blocks in `BlockPlaceEvent` using `BlockPlaceEvent->getBlock()`.\r\n- `MovingObjectPosition` has been removed.\r\n\r\n### Player\r\n- `Player->__construct()` no longer accepts a `clientID` parameter.\r\n- `Player->teleportImmediate()` has been removed.\r\n- `Player->getClientSecret()` has been removed.\r\n- `Player->getLastPlayed()` no longer always returns when the player started their current session. In the future it will only return when they last quit the server (or the same as firstPlayed if they haven't played before), but existing save data will still cause the bug until the player next joins.\r\n\r\n### Plugin\r\n- Added API method `PluginDescription->getMap()` which returns an associative array of the contents of `plugin.yml`.\r\n- `PluginLoader` interface now requires the implementation of `canLoadPlugin(string) : bool`.\r\n\r\n### Scheduler\r\n- Throwables thrown from `AsyncTask->onCompletion()` will no longer crash the server.\r\n\r\n### Server\r\n- `Server->updatePlayerListData()` now has an extra `xuid` parameter before the `players` parameter.\r\n- `Server->getResourceManager()` has been renamed to `Server->getResourcePackManager()`\r\n- `Server->addPlayer()` now accepts a `Player` as its only parameter.\r\n- `Server->addRecipe()` has been removed. Use `Server->getCraftingManager()->registerRecipe()` instead.\r\n- `Server->getConfigBoolean()` has been removed in favour of `Server->getConfigBool()`.\r\n- `Server->getDifficultyFromString()` has been removed in favour of its corresponding method in `Level`.\r\n- Added API methods `Server->getPlayerByUUID()` and `Server->getPlayerByRawUUID()`.\r\n\r\n### Utils\r\n- All generic utility functions have been moved from `PocketMine.php` to the `Utils` class.\r\n- Timezone-related functions have been moved to `pocketmine\\utils\\Timezone`.\r\n- `TextFormat::toANSI()` has been moved to `Terminal` since it directly pertains to the terminal output and has platform-dependent output.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Gameplay\r\n### Blocks\r\n- Fixed a block-updating race-condition bug causing ghost blocks to sometimes appear on the client-side.\r\n\r\n### Commands\r\n- Commands with aliases are now shown correctly on the client-side. Previously only the aliases would be visible and the original command would be missing.\r\n\r\n### Entities\r\n- Entity teleporting now is now correctly visible to players.\r\n- Regeneration effect no longer permits more than 2 sets of incoming damage per second on mobs.\r\n- Implemented Paintings.\r\n- Projectiles now use ray tracing for movement. This significantly improves movement of projectiles, particularly fixing arrows getting stuck in mid-air and clipping through the corners of blocks.\r\n- Arrows now make the correct collision sound and shake on impact.\r\n- Taking damage with Resistance levels >5 will no longer give the subject absorption hearts.\r\n- Falling blocks are no longer moved by liquid currents.\r\n\r\n### Items\r\n- Implemented Ender Pearls, Splash Potions and Bottle o' Enchanting.\r\n- Bows and throwable projectiles now make the correct sound when used.\r\n- Implemented armour durability.\r\n- Added some missing food items.\r\n- Fixed mess of incorrectly-registered Fish items.\r\n\r\n### Player\r\n- Xbox Live icons are now shown on the server list.\r\n- Fixed a slot count offset bug that caused changes to player armour not to be visible in the inventory.\r\n- Implemented critical hits.\r\n- Players can no longer eat food requiring hunger when in creative mode.\r\n- Fixed block placement bugs due to AABB floating-point inaccuracies.",

    "body": "**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.2.7, 1.2.8, 1.2.9**\r\nNew gameplay features, level I/O handling refactor, NBT refactor, changes to enchantments\r\n\r\n**This version is an alpha - it is not feature complete. Please do not create issues for missing gameplay features.**\r\n\r\nThis build has breaking API changes, so the API has been bumped to version 3.0.0-ALPHA11.\r\n\r\nPlease use our issue tracker to report bugs.\r\n\r\n# Notable changes\r\n## Core\r\n### General\r\n- Fixed `__FILE__` and `__LINE__` being interpreted as C++ macros on Jenkins builds. This did not cause any noticeable bugs, but was still undesirable.\r\n- The NBT library has been moved to its own Composer library, along with `pocketmine\\utils\\Binary` and `pocketmine\\utils\\BinaryStream`.\r\n- **Instabreak anti-cheat has been removed from the core code.** A plugin implementing this can be found at https://github.com/pmmp/AntiInstaBreak\r\n- Fixed a race condition causing log messages to not be written to `server.log` when the server crashes.\r\n- Fixed a crash when using /dumpmemory to dump AsyncWorker global variables.\r\n- Fixed memory dumps not including core class static properties.\r\n\r\n### Blocks\r\n- Fixed a crash when the right half of a double chest was destroyed while being viewed.\r\n\r\n### Commands\r\n- Fixed `/teleport` crash when extra spaces are placed between arguments.\r\n\r\n### Entities\r\n- Fixed a crash reading `CustomNameVisible` NBT tag from versions prior to API 3.0.0-ALPHA6.\r\n\r\n### Network\r\n- Added configuration option `network.max-mtu-size` to allow restricting the maximum byte size of packets sent without being split up. This may be useful to mitigate connection problems.\r\n\r\n### Level\r\n- Fixed ghost blocks bugs due to the block cache not getting cleared when chunks are replaced.\r\n- Fixed Region-based worlds leaking file resources (region GC was broken).\r\n- Entities are no longer close()d when changing levels. This fixes myriad bugs in plugins and finally properly resolves the age-old chunk unload memory leak without undesired behaviour.\r\n- Players joining LevelDB worlds with folder names that don't match the world display name will now not spawn up at y=32767.\r\n\r\n### Resource packs\r\n- Errors decoding pack manifests will now raise appropriate error messages instead of `TypeError`s.\r\n\r\n## API\r\n### Block\r\n- Added API methods `Block->getDropsForCompatibleTool()` and `Block->getSilkTouchDrops()`.\r\n- `Block->canBeBrokenWith()` has been renamed to `isCompatibleWithTool()`.\r\n\r\n### Enchantments\r\n- Enchantments have been split into enchantment types (`Enchantment`) and enchantment instances (`EnchantmentInstance`). `EnchantmentInstance`s should now be used for applying enchantments to items. This change permits various optimizations, and allows separation of immutable type data (such as ID, max level, applicable items, etc) and mutable instance data (such as a specific enchantment's level on an item).\r\n\r\n### Entity\r\n- XP API has undergone significant changes. Generic math-only XP logic functions have been moved to `ExperienceUtils` from `Human`.\r\n- Added the following `Human` API methods: `addXpLevels()`, `subtractXpLevels()`, `getCurrentTotalXp()`, `setCurrentTotalXp()`, `addXp()`, `subtractXp()`, `getLifetimeTotalXp()` and`setLifetimeTotalXp()`.\r\n- Added API methods `Entity->isInvisible()` and `Entity->setInvisible()`.\r\n- Data-property handling has undergone significant changes, see #1876 for details.\r\n- Added API method `Living->getArmorInventory()`\r\n\r\n### Events\r\n- `PlayerPreLoginEvent` is now called before whitelist and banlist checks are done. This fixes backwards incompatibilities with older plugins which broke after a previous update.\r\n- Cancelling `EntityEffectRemoveEvent` will now throw an exception if the effect's duration has expired.\r\n- Removed `EntityEatEvent` and subclasses. These events didn't make sense because of their hunger-centric nature, meaning that they only applied to Players regardless.\r\n\r\n### Inventory\r\n- Added a `$send` parameter to `Inventory->clearAll()`\r\n- Added a `$includeEmpty` parameter to `Inventory->getContents()`\r\n- Removed `Inventory->getHolder()`. Inventories no longer require that you give them an `InventoryHolder`. A holder is now optional to be implemented by subclasses and is not required to be an `InventoryHolder`.\r\n- Armor handling has been removed from `PlayerInventory` and separated into its own `ArmorInventory` class.\r\n  - All armor-related methods have been removed from `PlayerInventory`\r\n  - `ArmorInventory` now contains armor-specific logic. All living entities have an armor inventory.\r\n- Fixed `Player->removeWindow()` breaking client-sided GUI.\r\n\r\n### Item\r\n- Added API method `Item->getEnchantmentLevel()`, which returns the level of the enchantment on the item with the given ID, or 0 if it does not have the enchantment.\r\n- Removed `Item->getMaxDurability()` - this has been moved to `Durable` where it belongs.\r\n\r\n### Level\r\n- Added API method `Level->addGlobalPacket()`, which allows queuing a packet to be broadcasted to everyone in the level at the end of the tick, similar to how `addChunkPacket()` works.\r\n- Added API method `Level->dropExperience()`, which drops a given amount of XP as XP orbs into the world.\r\n- `LevelProvider`s are no longer dependent on Levels. This is a significant change because it makes it possible to construct `LevelProvider`s on threads without a `Level`, which opens up **future possibilities** to do many cool things:\r\n    - Super-simple world format conversion\r\n    - Asynchronous chunk I/O\r\n    **(DISCLAIMER: These things are NOT implemented yet, but are examples of things that COULD be done.)**\r\n- The `LevelProvider` interface has undergone significant changes. Unused or redundant methods have been stripped out, and the remaining methods have significant changes:\r\n    - `loadChunk()` now directly returns a `Chunk` object read from disk.\r\n    - `saveChunk()` now directly accepts a `Chunk` object instead of coordinates.\r\n    - `__construct()` now **only** accepts a `string $path`, the `Level` parameter has been removed.\r\n    - The following methods have been obsoleted, and therefore removed: `getChunk()`, `setChunk()`, `saveChunks()`, `unloadChunk()`, `unloadChunks()`, `isChunkLoaded()`,  `getLoadedChunks()`, `isChunkGenerated()`, `isChunkPopulated()` and `getLevel()`\r\n- `getServer()` method has been removed from `BaseLevelProvider`.\r\n\r\n### Math\r\n- Added `Math::solveQuadratic()`\r\n- Fixed `Vector2`'s coordinates magically incrementing when `ceil()` is used repeatedly\r\n- Added `VoxelRayTrace` containing two generator functions, which allow iterating over blocks on a line between two points.\r\n- Removed Math module dependency on `Level` (`AxisAlignedBB` depended on `MovingObjectPosition`).\r\n- Added `RayTraceResult`, which contains data for AxisAlignedBB ray trace results.\r\n\r\n### NBT\r\n- NBT read/write logic (streams) have been moved to `NBTStream` and its descendents.\r\n- `NBT` class is now abstract.\r\n- Removed `network` parameters and endianness fields from NBT stream handling. These are now encapsulated in separate implementations of `NBTStream` (`BigEndianNBTStream`, `LittleEndianNBTStream`, `NetworkLittleEndianNBTStream`).\r\n\r\n### Permission\r\n- Added `BanList->getEntry()`\r\n\r\n### Resource packs\r\n- Added API method `ResourcePackManager->getPath()`, which returns the path to the server's resource packs directory.\r\n\r\n### Utils\r\n- The public constant `TextFormat::EOL` has been added. **This should be used instead of `PHP_EOL` when preparing messages to send to players, since `PHP_EOL` is platform-dependent.**\r\n- API method `TextFormat::colorize()` has been added (see #1837 for details).\r\n- `BlockIterator` has been removed in favour of `math\\VoxelRayTrace`.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay\r\n### Blocks\r\n- Block break times will now display correctly when an incorrect or not good enough tool is used to break a block.\r\n- Fixed beds dropping in creative (#1525)\r\n- Fixed chest items getting rearranged when creating a double chest.\r\n\r\n### Effects\r\n- Hunger effect now applies as expected with high amplifiers.\r\n- Implemented the following effects: Saturation, Fatal Poison (used for parrots).\r\n- Levitation effect no longer triggers anti-flight.\r\n\r\n### Entities\r\n- Fixed all currently-known occurrences of blocks like fire burning mobs when they are not actually intersecting with the block.\r\n- Armour is now useful for damage types other than PvP.\r\n- Non-player entities can now wear armour (with the help of plugins).\r\n\r\n### Items\r\n- Implemented Potion effects\r\n- Implemented Chorus Fruit\r\n- Added sounds for Buckets\r\n- Buckets now show the correct liquid inside when used on still liquids\r\n- Empty buckets now stack to 16\r\n- Implemented the following enchantments: Respiration, Silk Touch, Efficiency, Unbreaking, Protection, Fire Protection, Blast Protection, Feather Falling, Projectile Protection.\r\n\r\n### Player\r\n- Fixed players' knockback being messed up.\r\n- Crafting grid contents is no longer dumped into the player's inventory after respawning.\r\n- Fixed interaction anti-cheat false-positives when doing the following (see #983):\r\n  - Standing on the corner of a block and breaking it/placing it (player was further than 0.5 blocks from block centre directionally)\r\n  - Breaking/placing blocks \"behind\" self by looking down and using multi-touch mode with mining circle on mobile devices.\r\n  - Breaking blocks right at the end of the survival reach distance.\r\n- Adventure mode no longer prevents interacting with blocks.\r\n- Implemented experience and experience orbs.",

    "body": "**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.2.6**\r\nAPI additions, gameplay additions, bugfixes, more performance, liquids refactor\r\n\r\n**This version is an alpha - it is not feature complete. Please do not create issues for missing gameplay features.**\r\n\r\nThis build does not have major breaking API changes, but has many new feature additions, so the API has been bumped to 3.0.0-ALPHA10.\r\nThis will likely be the last release in the ALPHAX series as we are planning to move to a new versioning system. Please see #1769 for details.\r\n\r\nPlease use our issue tracker to report bugs.\r\n\r\n# Notable changes\r\n## Core\r\n### General\r\n- RakLib and PocketMine-SPL are now Composer libraries instead of submodules. The installation process is exactly as before - simply run `composer install [...optional extra flags]` and the correct versions of RakLib and SPL will be installed.\r\n- The server will no longer crash when garbage is written in pocketmine.yml for `worlds` or `aliases`.\r\n- Minecraft PE 1.2 LevelDB worlds are now supported with https://github.com/pmmp/php-leveldb version 0.2.1 and the latest version of https://github/com/pmmp/leveldb-mcpe on branch `pmmp-merge`.\r\n- `server.properties` is no longer overwritten when stopping the server (finally!). However, there is one caveat - IF it has been modified at runtime (which rarely happens) without being saved, then it will still be overwritten.\r\n\r\n### Performance changes\r\n- Serialized spawn compounds are now cached by tiles for faster spawning. This significantly reduces chunk serialization overhead on the main thread when a chunk contains lots of tiles (since tile NBT has to be encoded on the main thread, and NBT is particularly slow). **Note that `Spawnable->onChanged()` MUST be called by implementations when their NBT changes, to ensure players see changes properly.**\r\n- `CraftingManager` now caches a pre-compressed crafting-data packet to reduce workload on player join.\r\n- Player skin geometry is now automatically stripped of pretty formatting to cut down on bandwidth overhead, since the geometry sizes tend to be very large.\r\n- `Level->isInWorld()` is no longer so horribly (relatively) expensive since the world height is now stored as a field in the level for faster comparison.\r\n- Liquid performance has been drastically improved.\r\n- Light population performance has been drastically improved using subchunk direct accessing (see below in API section).\r\n\r\n### Entity\r\n- Fixed errors when an effect duration becomes negative due to the level tick rate being > 1 (such as under lag when auto-tick-rate is enabled).\r\n\r\n### Level\r\n- The `disable-block-ticking` config in pocketmine.yml now works correctly.\r\n- Fixed crashes when `Level->getSafeSpawn()` encounters a non-full block.\r\n\r\n### Locale\r\n- Fixed incorrect translation key being used for level generation errors.\r\n\r\n### NBT\r\n- All known core code is now making use of the new CompoundTag API. **Note that the original method (using dynamic fields) is now deprecated and should be avoided, as it will cease to work in the future.**\r\n\r\n### Player\r\n- Players now respawn in the correct spawn world when dying in a different world. This was due to a bug with `Position->add()` returning a `Vector3` unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n### Resource packs\r\n- Resource pack UUIDs are now non-case-sensitive.\r\n\r\n## API\r\n### Block\r\n- Added API method `Block->getPickedItem()`\r\n\r\n### Commands\r\n- The JSON mess leftovers from pre-1.2 in commands have been obliterated. Good riddance.\r\n\r\n### Entity\r\n- `Human->sendSkin()` now accepts and defaults to NULL for its `targets` parameter. For a `Human`, using NULL will broadcast its skin to all players who can see it. For a `Player`, it will be broadcasted to all online players (for player list purposes).\r\n- `Entity->setCanClimb()` now has a default value of TRUE for its first parameter.\r\n- `Living->setMaxAirSupplyTicks()` now actually sets the MAX air ticks instead of the current air ticks.\r\n- `Living->addEffect()` now returns a boolean to indicate success.\r\n- Added API methods `Entity->flagForDespawn()` and `Entity->isFlaggedForDespawn()`. These should be used instead of `kill()/close()` and `isAlive()` respectively when wanting to delete an entity without killing it and creating drops. Setting the despawn flag will cause the entity to be deleted on the next tick.\r\n\r\n### Events\r\n- Block face click vector is now accessible in `PlayerInteractEvent` for `RIGHT_CLICK_BLOCK` action. I don't know why this wasn't already accessible, but now you can go and make yourself some nice touchscreens with maps.\r\n- Player data is once again saved after `PlayerQuitEvent`. This resolves issues with plugins doing odd things like killing players on quit.\r\n- Cancelling `EntityEffectAddEvent` and `EntityEffectRemoveEvent` now work correctly when cancelled.\r\n\r\n### Inventory\r\n- `SlotChangeAction` now checks if the slot number is valid before trying to get items from the inventory - this fixes errors with players putting items at out of bounds offsets when PlayerInteractEvent is cancelled on a crafting table.\r\n\r\n### Items\r\n- Added API methods `Armor->getCustomColor()` and `Armor->setCustomColor()`\r\n\r\n### Level\r\n- Added API method `Chunk->getSavableEntities()`\r\n- `Level->getName()` no longer crashes after the level has been unloaded and the provider doesn't exist anymore.\r\n- Added a `SubChunkIteratorManager` to modularize the code for faster subchunk accessing. This is now used in `LightUpdate` and `Explosion` and provides drastic performance enhancements.\r\n\r\n### NBT\r\n- Extra parameters have been added to `CompoundTag`'s reading methods to allow returning the default when the tag type doesn't match expected.\r\n- Extra parameters have been added to `CompoundTag`'s writing methods to allow forcefully overwriting existing tags with a type that is not what was expected.\r\n\r\n### Player\r\n- Added API method `Player->getLocale()`. This returns a locale code of the style `en_US`.\r\n- Added API method `Player->getPing()`. This is reported by RakLib every 5 seconds and returns the player's last measured latency in milliseconds.\r\n- Fixed bugs with bad time values for `Player->hasPlayedBefore()` by reusing calculated time when generating player data for the first time.\r\n\r\n### Resource packs\r\n- Added API method `ResourcePack->getPath()` - this returns a path to the resource pack's file(s).\r\n\r\n### Server\r\n- `Server->getConfigBoolean()` has been deprecated; its replacement is `Server->getConfigBool()`. The original will be removed in a later version.\r\n- Added API method `Server->getResourcePath()` - this points to the server's file resource directory in the source/phar (`src/pocketmine/resources/`).\r\n\r\n### Utils\r\n- Added API method `Config->removeNested()`\r\n- Added API method `Color::mix()`\r\n\r\n## Gameplay\r\n### Blocks\r\n- Liquids have undergone a major refactor, the following issues have been fixed:\r\n  - CPU leaks when liquids try to flow into other liquids have been fixed\r\n  - Liquids no longer flow all over the place when they have a downwards path of least resistance\r\n  - Liquids no longer flow in all directions when flowing down a slope instead of just down the slope\r\n  - Lava is no longer impossible to get rid of when deleting the source block\r\n  - Lava no longer turns to cobblestone when flowing over the top of water\r\n  - Performance has been drastically improved\r\n  - Mobs now move correctly when liquids flow around them\r\n\r\n- Added the following blocks: ender chest (#1462), banner (#1331)\r\n- Block-picking crops will now give the correct item instead of the crop block itself.\r\n\r\n### Commands\r\n- Basic command lists are now visible on the client when typing `/`. Arguments are not yet implemented and will always show `[args: message]` (this will come in the future).\r\n- Fixed a crash when attempting to create ListTags with JSON in the `/give` command.\r\n\r\n### Entities\r\n- Teleported entities will no longer continue to take damage from the blocks at their origin.\r\n- Entity death smoke cloud now works correctly.\r\n\r\n### Items\r\n- Added the following items: banner, rotten flesh\r\n\r\n### Level\r\n- Implemented sky light reduction based on time of day. This is used for various things including mob spawning (not implemented yet), grass growth and crop growth (not implemented yet).\r\n\r\n### Player\r\n- Falling more than 3.5 blocks now correctly causes fall damage (incorrect floor() instead of ceil()).\r\n- Added a hack to stop players falling into the ground on spawn.",

These changes are NOT yet complete.\r\n\r\n# Notable changes\r\n## Core\r\n### General\r\n- Minimum PHP version has been upped to PHP 7.2.0RC3 due to more bugfixes needed for ZTS mode.\r\n- Fixed PocketMine.php compatibility with PHP 5 (needed for incompatible PHP version messages to work correctly)\r\n- Incompatible PHP version message on startup is now more clear and tells the user what PHP version they are attempting to use.\r\n\r\n### Block\r\n- Fixed a crash when Leaves2 is mined with a damage value > 1\r\n\r\n### Entity\r\n- Fixed debug spam when entities are created over zero tick diffs.\r\n- Entities which are saved when on fire will now appear on fire when they are next loaded.\r\n\r\n### Level\r\n- Fixed performance degradation in `Level->getBlock()` which had very widespread effects.\r\n- Fixed performance degradation with chunk ticking caused by expensive subchunk empty checks.\r\n- Difficulty levels can now be set per-world, and can be set in pocketmine.yml using the `difficulty` key under the worlds section per-world.\r\n\r\n### Network\r\n- Chunk-packet caching is now non-optional, offering better performance (#1448)\r\n- Compression level 0 in pocketmine.yml is no longer allowed and will be reset to the default if used.\r\n- Fixed a crash which occurred during login verification due to trying to read a nonexistent public key\r\n- Fixed ridiculous network upload & download statistics when the title ticker was disabled\r\n- Removed a redundant asserting function in packet reads which was degrading performance.\r\n\r\n## API\r\n### General\r\n- Added `\\pocketmine\\NAME` constant.\r\n\r\n### Block\r\n- Basic support has been added for separation of block bounding boxes and collision boxes. `Block->getCollisionBoxes()` has been added.\r\n\r\n### Command\r\n- Added API method `SimpleCommandMap->unregister()` to allow completely removing registered commands.\r\n\r\n### Entity\r\n#### Skins\r\nA new `Skin` class has been added to allow proper management of player skins.\r\nThe following classes have been added:\r\n  - `pocketmine\\entity\\Skin`\r\n\r\nThe following events have been added:\r\n  - `PlayerChangeSkinEvent`, called when a player changes their skin\r\n\r\nThe following API methods have been removed:\r\n  - `Human->getSkinId() : string`\r\n  - `Human->getSkinData() : string`\r\n\r\nThe following API methods have been added:\r\n  - `Human->getSkin() : Skin`\r\n  - `Human->sendSkin(Player[])` The following methods have signature changes:\r\n  - `Human->setSkin()` now accepts `Skin` instead of `string, string`\r\n  - `Server->updatePlayerListData()` now accepts ` Skin` instead of the old skin string parameters.\r\n\r\n#### Other changes\r\n- Projectile-related classes such as `Projectile`, `ProjectileSource`, `Snowball` etc have been moved to an `entity\\projectile` namespace.\r\n- Added `EntityIds` interface containing named constants for Minecraft: Bedrock entity type IDs.\r\n- Added API methods `Entity->canSaveWithChunk()` and `Entity->setCanSaveWithChunk()`. These methods allow marking an entity as non-permanent so that it does not get saved to disk when the chunk is saved.\r\n- Added API method `Entity::createBaseNBT()` to allow creation of base NBT needed to spawn an entity without boilerplate CompoundTags everywhere.\r\n- Added API method `Living->lookAt()` to make a mob turn and look at a certain position.\r\n- `Entity->spawnTo()` should no longer be overridden for sending packets for spawning entities to players; override `Entity->sendSpawnPacket()` instead.\r\n- Setting villager profession now shows the correct profession on the client side.\r\n- `Villager::PROFESSION_GENERIC` has been removed since it does not exist in vanilla and crashes players if used.\r\n- A range of API methods have been added to allow controlling entity oxygen supply (2601e359907fca98d95b10454256157977282f90)\r\n\r\n### Events\r\n- Removed `PlayerMoveEvent->setFrom()`.\r\n- Added `PlayerChangeSkinEvent`\r\n\r\n### Inventory\r\n- Added `BaseInventory->removeAllViewers()` and `BaseInventory->dropContents()`.\r\n\r\n### Level\r\n- FloatingTextParticle now uses a transparent skin so that the tiny player cannot be seen.\r\n- Explosions now correctly remove tiles.\r\n\r\n### NBT\r\n- A range of new methods have been added to `CompoundTag`'s API to allow more sane handling of the data they contain. See #1469 for details.\r\n- `tagType` parameter has been added to `ListTag`'s constructor.\r\n\r\n### Item\r\n- `Durable` class has been added to abstract damage handling away from tools directly.\r\n- `Enchantment::registerEnchantment()` method has been added.\r\n- Items with out-of-bounds damage values will no longer crash the server.\r\n- Serializing ItemBlocks which have previously been used to place blocks will no longer raise exceptions\r\n- `Item->getNamedTag()` will now return an empty `CompoundTag` if the item does not have any NBT; this change was made after seeing that this function is only ever used when wanting to alter the item's NBT.\r\n- Added API methods `Item->setNamedTagEntry()` and `Item->removeNamedTagEntry()`\r\n- Added some constants for commonly-accessed item NBT tags.\r\n- Some unnecessary/obsolete item classes have been removed.\r\n\r\n### Player\r\n- Added `Player->getXuid()` - note that this will ONLY return a valid XUID for players logged into Xbox Live\r\n- Changed stupid default values for `Player->setAllowMovementCheats()` and `Player->setAllowInstaBreak()`\r\n\r\n### Scheduler\r\n- An ErrorException-throwing error handler is now set on AsyncWorkers. Due to a bug in PHP pthreads causing warnings not to get output, you may experience unexpected errors/crashes in AsyncTasks where previously everything appeared to work fine due to silenced warnings.\r\n\r\n### Utils\r\n- Fixed `Binary::unsignShort()` mistakenly being non-static\r\n\r\n## Gameplay\r\n### General\r\n- Arrows will now fly through smaller spaces as their bounding boxes have been corrected.\r\n- Arrows can no longer be shot through the top part of a stair.\r\n- Fixed getting kicked for flight when walking on top of fences, fence-gates and stairs.\r\n- Fixed a range of bugs with entity movement and collision on fences, fence-gates, glass panes, iron bars,\r\n doors and a wide variety of other blocks (collision checks on these now account for their correct shape instead of assuming a cuboid bounding box). These bugs occurred due to outdated bounding box caches when blocks' shapes updated.\r\n- Movement anti-cheat is now disabled by default on new installations.\r\n- Oxygen supply is no longer used when the player is underwater in creative or spectator modes.\r\n- Players will no longer take damage on respawn when they were killed while falling from causes other than fall damage.\r\n- Peaceful difficulty no longer disables player-versus-player combat.\r\n- Skins with custom capes and geometry models are now supported.\r\n\r\n### Blocks\r\n- Added the following:\r\n  - concrete powder\r\n  - red sandstone, red sandstone stairs and red sandstone slabs\r\n  - purpur, purpur stairs and purpur slabs\r\n  - end stone bricks\r\n- Beds no longer leave their other halves behind invisible when broken in survival mode.\r\n- Buttons now have the correct rotation when placed.\r\n- Dead bush now drops 0-2 sticks instead of itself.\r\n- Falling blocks will now fall when placed above fire.\r\n- Falling blocks landing in water will no longer overwrite wrong blocks when moved slightly by currents.\r\n- Farmland will now hydrate when <= 4 blocks from water (crops don't take notice of this yet)\r\n- Farmland and grass path will now turn to dirt if a solid block is placed on top of them.\r\n- Mob heads no longer rotate 45 degrees sideways when placed facing north\r\n- Slab placement in half-block gaps should now (finally!) work correctly.\r\n\r\n### Crafting\r\n- Shift-clicking on the recipe book to batch-craft items now works correctly.\r\n- Crafting using mirrored asymmetric shaped recipes now works correctly.\r\n\r\n### Entities\r\n- Mob death animations now last the correct length of time.\r\n- Dropped items are now destroyed by lava.\r\n\r\n### Items\r\n- Flint and steel will now play a sound when a fire is created.\r\n- Hoes and shovels now break when their damage exceeds their durability (although still take double damage).\r\n- Implemented writable and written books (#1397)",

    "body": "**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.2.0.81**\r\nRewritten inventory transaction handling, (mostly) fixed desktop crafting, implemented Xbox Live authentication\r\n\r\n**This version is an alpha snapshot, is NOT FEATURE COMPLETE and may be unstable. Please use our issue tracker to report bugs.**\r\n\r\n**Please do not create issues for missing gameplay features.**\r\n\r\nThis build has breaking API changes, so the API has been bumped to 3.0.0-ALPHA8. These changes are NOT yet complete.\r\n\r\n# Notable changes\r\n## Core\r\n- Composer is now required to run a server from source-code.\r\n- Xbox Live authentication has been implemented and is enabled by default.\r\n- The server no longer crashes when loading an old world containing furnaces with missing NBT tags.\r\n- Stats reporting can now be disabled from the command-line using `--anonymous-statistics.enabled=0`\r\n- Players with spaces in their names are now accepted on the server.\r\n  - Following from the above, commands now support quoted arguments, so if you want to kick player `Rotten Eggs`, use quotes, like so: `/kick \"Rotten Eggs\" reason why`\r\n\r\n## API\r\n### Block\r\n- Added API method `BlockFactory::isRegistered()`\r\n\r\n### Events\r\n- Added `PlayerBlockPickEvent`\r\n- API method `CraftItemEvent->getTransaction()` has been added and returns a `CraftingTransaction` object.\r\n- `InventoryTransactionEvent->getTransaction()` now returns an `InventoryTransaction` instead of a `TransactionGroup`\r\n\r\n### Inventory\r\nThe inventory transaction system has been almost completely rewritten, the following things have changed:\r\n\r\n- The general naming of TransactionGroups and Transactions has been refactored to Transaction and InventoryAction respectively as the original naming did not make sense.\r\n\r\n- Removed `SimpleTransactionGroup`, `TransactionGroup`, `BaseTransaction`, `Transaction` and `SlotType` classes\r\n\r\n- Added the following:\r\n  - `InventoryTransaction` - used for regular inventory transactions, this replaces the old SimpleTransactionGroup in terms of functionality\r\n  - `CraftingTransaction` - represents an `InventoryTransaction` in which the actions are to create a crafted item.\r\n  - `InventoryAction` - base class which represents a change in the amount of an item, somewhere. This has several subclasses:\r\n    - `SlotChangeAction`: Represents a change of the amount of an item in a specific slot of an inventory. This replaces the functionality of the old `BaseTransaction`.\r\n    - `DropItemAction`: Represents a player throwing an item onto the ground out of their inventory.\r\n    - `CreativeInventoryAction`: Represents the action of creating or deleting items using the creative menu.\r\n    - `CraftingTransferMaterialAction`: Represents the action of consuming a crafting ingredient, or getting a secondary output from a crafting event (don't try too hard to understand this)\r\n    - `CraftingTakeResultAction`: Represents a player taking the primary result item from the crafting grid result slot.\r\n\r\n- `CraftingGrid` and `BigCraftingGrid` have been added. **Note for plugin developers: if you change the contents of these, players _will not see_ the changes, due to a limitation in the current 1.2 client**.\r\n\r\n- `PlayerCursorInventory` has been added - this is a container representing the item under the cursor on desktop platforms. **Note that sending this inventory's contents does not work correctly due to a bug in the current 1.2 client.**\r\n\r\n- `InventoryType` has been removed\r\n\r\n- API methods `BaseInventory->getDefaultTitle()`, `BaseInventory->getDefaultSize()` and `ContainerInventory->getNetworkType()` have been added.\r\n\r\n- Due to changes in the 1.2 client, the API for changing hotbar linked slots has been removed - they now behave the same way as Minecraft PC Edition does. The following obsolete API methods have been removed:\r\n  - `PlayerInventory->resetHotbar()`\r\n  - `PlayerInventory->getHotbarSlotIndex()`\r\n  - `PlayerInventory->setHotbarSlotIndex()`\r\n  - `PlayerInventory->setHeldItemSlot()`\r\n\r\n- `BaseInventory->getItem()` and `BaseInventory->setItem()` will now throw an exception if an out-of-bounds inventory slot index is given.\r\n\r\n- `ShapedRecipe`'s constructor has been changed, it now accepts `Item $result, string[] $shape, Item[] $shapeItems, Item[] $extraResults`.\r\n\r\n- Removed `BigShapedRecipe` and `BigShapelessRecipe` - these have been obsoleted by the addition of `CraftingRecipe->requiresCraftingTable()`\r\n\r\n- Added `send` parameters to `BaseInventory->clear()`, `BaseInventory->setItem()`.\r\n\r\n### Item\r\n- Added API method `Item->isNull()`, which returns true if the count of the item is less than or equal to 0, or if its ID is air.\r\n- Added API method `Item->equalsExact()` which asserts that the ID, count, damage and NBT must all be identical.\r\n- Added API method `ItemFactory::isRegistered()`\r\n\r\n### Level\r\n- The server no longer crashes if a plugin uses `Level->unload()` directly. **Note that you should not be using this anyway!!! Use `Server->unloadLevel()` instead.**\r\n\r\n### Plugins\r\n- Refactored API checking code into its own function (`PluginManager->isCompatibleApi(string ...$apiVersions)`)\r\n\r\n### Scheduler & AsyncTasks\r\n- Added API method `AsyncTask->storeLocal()`, which must be explictly called to store objects in the scheduler object store. This replaces the functionality of `AsyncTask->__construct()` because the old behaviour was too easy to use by accident. See #1322 for details.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay\r\n- Implemented Coarse Dirt\r\n- Eating sounds now work correctly.\r\n- Reverted botched fix for #145 that caused problems with double slabs.\r\n- Desktop crafting now works (except for a crash when using the recipe book - WIP)",

This version is NOT FEATURE COMPLETE and may be unstable. PMMP is not responsible for nuclear war, explosions or loss of data resulting from use of this build. Please use our issue tracker to report bugs.**\r\n\r\nThis build has breaking API changes, so the API has been bumped to 3.0.0-ALPHA7. These changes are NOT yet complete.\r\n\r\n**NOTE: This will be the last big release to support PHP 7.0.**\r\n\r\n# Notable changes\r\n## Core\r\n- Backtraces no longer incorrectly show a `boolean` parameter when a function call in the stack trace had no parameters.\r\n- Configs will now save correctly when the type was auto-detected due to being unspecified.\r\n- Fixed RakLibInterface crashing when exceptions are raised during packet handling, after the player was closed.\r\n- Fixed UUIDs becoming corrupted when converted to strings\r\n- Fixed crashes caused by NBT TAG_Short being written as signed but read as unsigned.\r\n- Plugin load error messages such as \"incompatible API version\" and \"Unknown dependency\" are now more verbose\r\n- Significant performance enhancements to entity ticking and to explosions\r\n- The server will no longer crash when players join if the spawn radius is set to 0.\r\n\r\n## API\r\n### The big breaking changes\r\nA large number of API methods and interfaces have prototype changes - addition of scalar typehints throughout the code. The most breaking of these for plugins are the following:\r\n  - `CommandExecutor->onCommand()`:\r\n    - before: `onCommand(CommandSender $sender, Command $command, $label, $args)`\r\n    - after: `onCommand(CommandSender $sender, Command $command, string $label, $args) : bool`\r\n  - `Task->onRun()`:\r\n    - before: `onRun($currentTick)`\r\n    - after: `onRun(int $currentTick)`\r\n\r\nPlugins implementing these methods will require the implementing methods' signatures changing to comply with the core code.\r\n**NOTE THAT THESE CHANGES ARE NOT FINAL.** PHP 7.2 will add `void` and nullable return typehints which will also be made use of when we move to PHP 7.2.\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n#### Commands\r\n- Added `InvalidCommandSyntaxException`. Throwing this exception in a Command's execution function will cause its usage to be displayed. This is used to reduce repeated code in the built-in commands and has not been tested from a `CommandExecutor` perspective (yet).\r\n\r\n#### Block\r\n- Plugins can now register their own custom blocks and/or override existing implementations. Refer to `BlockFactory` for documentation.\r\n- Block ID constants are now generated automatically from vanilla. In the mix, many old aliases which didn't make sense have been removed.\r\n- Several Block classes have been removed due to excess duplication. Blocks are now instantiated by creating clones of pre-initialized objects registered in BlockFactory.\r\n- `Block->canBeActivated()` and `Item->canBeActivated()` have been removed due to extra confusion they caused in the implementation of new gameplay features.\r\n- `Block->getDrops()` now returns `Item[]` instead of `int[][]`. Plugins which use this method will need alterations.\r\n- `Block::get()` now redirects to `BlockFactory::get()`. This is backwards compatible with existing implementations.\r\n- `Block::get()` will now throw exceptions when out-of-bounds block IDs or block meta values are given.\r\n- `new Block()` should now **only** be used for constructing **block types**. `Block::get()` or `BlockFactory::get()` should be used instead for getting block instances to set into the world.\r\n- `Block->getResistance()` has been deprecated, superseded by `Block->getBlastResistance()`.\r\n- Added API method `Block->ticksRandomly() : bool` (used for level random block ticking registration, see below)\r\n\r\n#### Entity\r\n- Obsolete first parameters have been removed from `Entity->attack()` and `Entity->heal()`.\r\n- `Entity->getHealth()` now returns a float, and `Entity->setHealth()` now accepts floats.\r\n- Redundant public property `Entity->length` has been removed.\r\n- `Entity->closed` is now protected, use `Entity->isClosed()` instead. (eebc52e00ba6ad38bf1c249a6f0e9415c81d5072)\r\n\r\n#### Events\r\n- Added the following events:\r\n  - NetworkInterfaceCrashEvent\r\n  - NetworkInterfaceRegisterEvent\r\n  - NetworkInterfaceUnregisterEvent\r\n  - PlayerJumpEvent\r\n- Fixed `EntityEatBlockEvent` not being called when a player eats a slice of cake\r\n- Fixed `PlayerBucketEmptyEvent` not being used anywhere\r\n\r\n#### Item\r\n- Plugins can now register their own custom items and/or override existing implementations. Refer to `ItemFactory` for documentation.\r\n- Item ID constants are now generated automatically from vanilla. In the mix, many old aliases which didn't make sense have been removed.\r\n- Added API methods `Item->hasEnchantment(int, int) : bool`, `Item->removeEnchantment(int, int)`, `Item->removeEnchantments()`\r\n- Added API methods `Item->getAttackPoints() : int` and `Item->getDefensePoints() : int`\r\n- Many redundant item classes have been removed due to excess duplication. Items are now instantiated by creating clones of pre-initialized objects registered in `ItemFactory`.\r\n- `Item->clearCustomBlockData()` now works correctly.\r\n- `new Item()` should now **only** be used for constructing **item types**. `Item::get()` or `ItemFactory::get()` should be used instead for getting item instances to set into an inventory.\r\n- `Item::get()` and `Item::fromString()` now redirect to their respective methods in `ItemFactory`. This is backwards compatible with existing implementations. \r\n- The `count` parameter has been removed from `Item::__construct()`.\r\n- Fixed issues with serialize/deserialize items from NBT where the tag kept the wrong name\r\n\r\n#### Level\r\n- `Level->dropItem()` now returns a reference to the created item entity.\r\n- `Nether` generator no longer returns `normal` in `getName()`.\r\n\r\n#### Math\r\n- Added precision and rounding mode arguments to `Vector3->round()`. This defaults to the original behaviour if the arguments are not specified.\r\n- `Position->equals()` and `Location->equals()` will now additionally check level (if the parameter is an instance of Position) and yaw/pitch (if the parameter is an instance of Location) respectively. (b8a30309bbc4ec8600669ea0794c7d3d68c4a415)\r\n\r\n#### Network\r\n- MCPE packets are now registered in `pocketmine\\network\\mcpe\\protocol\\PacketPool`. API methods `registerPacket()` and `getPacket()` have been removed from `Network`. This is to allow easier auto-generation of protocol-related code.\r\n- Added `PlayerNetworkSessionAdapter`. This is currently used to reduce the amount of empty handlers in `Player`, however this may cause problems which override handlers in `Player` to handle packets. Plugins which override `Player->handleDataPacket()` should still work correctly, provided that you remember to call the parent.\r\n *The developers are aware that this is an API problem and this will be resolved in a future update. Please remember that the network refactor is **not finished** and don't kill the developers.*\r\n- `Packet->decode()` and `Packet->encode()` should no longer be overridden by plugins as core functionality is performed in here. Use `Packet->decodePayload()` and `Packet->encodePayload()` when creating new packets.\r\n\r\n#### Plugin handling\r\n- Plugins can now specify the `mcpe-protocol` attribute in plugin.yml to specify compatible protocol versions.\r\n- Specifying API as `2.0` when the server API is `2.0.0` or similar is now legal and will work correctly.\r\n- Fixed plugins with unknown dependencies claiming to have circular dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Tasks\r\n- The `MainLogger` is now accessible in AsyncTasks by use of `MainLogger::getLogger()`.\r\n- Throwing exceptions during `Task->onCancel()` will no longer cause server crashes and undesirable behaviour.\r\n- `ServerScheduler->scheduleAsyncTask()` now returns the ID of the worker the task was scheduled to.\r\n\r\n#### Tile\r\n- Added some methods to `tile\\Sign` and `SignChangeEvent` for consistency. (42fb1d1fef47ae7cc55794764aa4057364348616)\r\n- `Sign->setText()` now accepts null parameters to leave the text on those lines as-is.\r\n- `Spawnable->getSpawnCompound()` is now final. Plugins implementing custom tiles should instead override `Spawnable->addAdditionalSpawnData()`. See #1259 for changes and examples.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay\r\n### Blocks\r\n- Implemented: bone block, coloured beds, concrete, double plants, end rod, glazed terracotta, magma, nether wart, nether wart block, red nether brick, stained glass\r\n- Beds can no longer be slept in beyond a 2-block distance.\r\n- Fixed beds not requiring a solid block under the head\r\n- Fixed bookshelves dropping themselves instead of 3 books\r\n- Fixed quartz pillar rotation not working correctly\r\n- Grass growth and death now works correctly.\r\n- Lit redstone lamp block now emits the correct amount of light.\r\n- Obsidian can no longer be destroyed by TNT\r\n- Placing rails is now less weird (they still won't join up though yet).\r\n- Re-added Nether Reactor core (decorative only, as in vanilla)\r\n\r\n### Commands\r\n- Command usage messages are now translated server-side to resolve client-side translation issues.\r\n\r\n### Entities\r\n- Armor will now correctly absorb damage when the resulting damage from an attack is less than 1 point.\r\n- Fixed mobs such as zombies and villagers not having their positions updated server-side when something causes them to gain motion. This fixes problems with floating mobs and zombies being unkillable in earlier versions. As an added bonus, the change fixing this problem brought in substantial performance improvements. See 2f3c77c68a0d9e0fdfb0eb69bd44344f4c8d028d and c32b75fa188bcee58aa46977e97e140532fc47ba for details.\r\n- Fixed cake not applying any food/saturation to the eater\r\n- Absorption and damage resistance now absorb the correct amount of damage when armor is worn.\r\n\r\n### Inventory\r\n- Several furnace fuel items which did not work before now work correctly.\r\n- Armor screen on PE will no longer duplicate armor items when equipping armor.\r\n\r\n### World\r\n- Fixed level random block ticking not being random anymore on the third iteration\r\n- The presence of a spectator player will no longer prevent building at a target.\r\n- Players will no longer take decades to spawn when the server is generating a new world. This was caused by a bug in chunk requesting causing the server not to fully utilize the CPU, which significantly delayed chunk generation before spawn.",

THIS BUILD IS NOT FEATURE-COMPLETE AND IS LIKELY TO BE HIGHLY UNSTABLE. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR NUCLEAR WAR, EXPLOSIONS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA RESULTING FROM USE OF THIS BUILD.**\r\n\r\nThis build has breaking API changes, so the API has been bumped to 3.0.0-ALPHA6. These changes are NOT yet complete.\r\n\r\n# Notable changes\r\n## Core\r\n- 32-bit support has been removed for consistency and performance reasons. (#984)\r\n- The `Binary` class now has strict types and type-hinting for safety reasons when writing data to network.\r\n- Fixed incorrect PC world format versions causing Mojang's official McRegion -> Anvil converter to reject PocketMine-MP-generated McRegion worlds.\r\n- Fixed ServerKiller does not work correctly on single-core machines.\r\n- AsyncTasks no longer leak memory after completion. (#922)\r\n- Fixed masses of console spam when a crash occurs and an NBT tag or EncapsulatedPacket was an argument somewhere in the call stack.\r\n- NBT ListTags now default to TAG_End if no tag type is specified instead of null.\r\n- Fixed /particle command crash when creating TerrainParticle or ItemBreakParticle\r\n- Player `XpSeed` is now restricted to the bounds of an int32 on all platform (since it is supposed to be saved as an IntTag, which is bounded to the range of an int32).\r\n- Player->close() now does its best to catch thrown exceptions and clean up after itself to avoid possible leaks and issues during the quit process.\r\n- Fixed AutoUpdater crashing the server when invalid data is returned by the updater host.\r\n- Changed updater host to https://update.pmmp.io\r\n- Changed crash-archive host to https://crash.pmmp.io\r\n- Fixed some issues with static properties not being included in memory dumps.\r\n- Fixed server crashing when crashing while creating a CrashDump.\r\n- Fixed silenced errors being reported in CrashDumps when a plugin uses `exit()` or `die()`.\r\n- Fixed lots of bugs exposed by strict types.\r\n\r\n## Network\r\n- Chunk serialization and compression is now always done asynchronously to improve performance.\r\n- Level area-broadcasted packets and block updates are now sent in batches instead of individual packets to improve performance.\r\n- Workaround for packets sent with immediate priority being ignored by the client (#1026)\r\n- Fixed UUID encoding (players will no longer see themselves twice in the player list)\r\n- ResourcePackDataInfoPacket will now report the correct number of resource pack chunks.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay\r\n- Dropped items no longer bounce on partial blocks such as slabs.\r\n- Fixed hunger decreasing too fast.\r\n- Fixed server crash when vines are placed on some block faces.\r\n- Falling sand is no longer destroyed by grass and no longer destroys slabs.\r\n- Falling into water 1 block deep no longer causes fall damage.\r\n- Removed eye-height offsets causing spawned entities to appear in wrong positions on the client-side.\r\n- Arrows will now fly correctly towards targets and no longer spin round and fall flat when hitting a surface.\r\n- Implemented basic sky-light population on chunk generation and sky-light updating when blocks are changed in the world. This will be needed for proper farming.\r\n- Improved player movement (smoother, much less stuttery) and fixed several client-sided positioning bugs.\r\n- Fixed other players don't see teleport movement when teleporting to nearby locations.\r\n- Fixed player spawn points set using /spawnpoint not working.\r\n\r\n## API\r\n- Strict types are now enabled throughout the core code. See #969 and #993 for details.\r\n- Plugins can now specify the `extensions` attribute in plugin.yml to specify PHP extensions required for the plugin to function correctly. This may be useful where plugins require extensions which are not supplied by default with PMMP-supplied PHP binaries. (#903)\r\n- Added `Vector3->asVector3()`, `Position->asPosition()`, `Location->asLocation()` (#973). This is intended to provide an easy way to convert a descendent of one of these classes (such as an `Entity`) into an explicit Vector3, Position or Location.\r\n- Added the following events: \r\n  - PlayerDataSaveEvent, which is called when a player's NBT data is about to be saved to disk. (#920) \r\n  - UpdateNotifyEvent, which is called when the AutoUpdater receives information that a new PocketMine-MP version is available.\r\n- PlayerInteractEvent is now called with the left-click action when a player attempts to remove an item from an item frame.\r\n- NBT classes now have more strict type-checking in the constructors, `Tag->getValue()` and `Tag->setValue()`. ByteTags, ShortTags and IntTags will now throw an exception if the supplied value is outside of the range they can store.\r\n- Block constructors will now always retain the meta values passed in the constructor, fixes issues with crafting with recipes that required any-damage ingredients.\r\n- Added API methods `Block->canClimb()`, `Entity->canClimb()`, `Entity->setCanClimb(bool)`, `Entity->canClimbWalls()` and `Entity->setCanClimbWalls(bool)` along with corresponding entity metadata flags.\r\n- Added API methods `Block->getLightFilter()` and `Block->diffusesSkyLight()` (used in sky light population).\r\n- Added `/title` command and API for resetting title durations.\r\n- Refactored some JSON-parsing-specific NBT code into its own class.\r\n- Added `Server->broadcastTitle()`.\r\n- `Item->setLore()` is now fluent.",

These changes are NOT yet complete.\r\n\r\n# Notable changes\r\n## Core\r\n- World format implementations using Regions will now be more thoroughly checked for validity before the core attempts to use them. (#393)\r\n- Fixed a crash that would prevent a world from being at all usable if a Human was created with an invalid skin.\r\n- Fixed chunk object memory leak when chunks are replaced by the generator.\r\n- Tile and Entity NBT trees are now destroyed when their close() methods are called to combat memory leaks.\r\n- Fixed tile and entity object memory leaks and crashes when replacing chunks\r\n- Chunk->addTile(Tile) and Chunk->addEntity(Entity) will now throw exceptions if something attempts to add a closed tile or entity to them.\r\n- Fixed squid health attribute errors\r\n- Fixed server crash when taking damage after dying when the Health Boost effect was applied before death.\r\n- Fixed crashes when using xdebug and breaking very tall cacti or sugarcane (recursive block updates)\r\n- Fixed some packets being sent with reliability level 0, may improve connections randomly being dropped\r\n- Fixed memory leak related to persistent entities when lots of players join and quit a server in the same area\r\n- Fixed possible item NBT duplication where items were holding references to the same NBT trees when cloned.\r\n- Fixed usage always being reported even when disabled in pocketmine.yml\r\n- Fixed stack traces in the logger sometimes missing the top stack frame.\r\n- Fixed Entity object memory leak in EntityDamageByEntityEvent\r\n- Fixed Player object memory leak when players subscribed to the administrative broadcast permission quit the server\r\n- Non-generated chunks will no longer be saved to disk, fixes big dirty holes in some maps due to chunks being saved before being generated\r\n- Rewritten the chunk sending algorithm, much better chunk sending (will now actually reach the horizon)\r\n- Fixed a major memory leak when a W10 player set a very high render distance due to the server not enforcing radius limits. This has been corrected,. A player's render distance will now be set to the minimum of the spawn radius, the player's radius, or the server default render distance.\r\n- The settings `chunk-sending.max-chunks` has been removed from pocketmine.yml in favour of a more vanilla `view-distance` setting in server.properties (values match MCPE render distance settings) and `chunk-sending.spawn-threshold` has been replaced with `chunk-sending.spawn-radius` (again, same values as MCPE).\r\n- Fixed CPU waste of batched packets sometimes being encoded twice.\r\n- Auto-updater checks are now done with an AsyncTask to prevent slowdown on server start.\r\n- Added debug output for lots of network- and protocol-related things.\r\n\r\n## API\r\n- Massive refactor of the network namespace. All packets have moved from network\\protocol to network\\mcpe\\protocol, and Info has been renamed to ProtocolInfo. This is to make space for future changes. **Note that these changes are far from complete and more will follow.**\r\n- Added API methods to Player to allow transferring them to other servers, and to allow sending titles.\r\n- Added Entity API for setting entity scale.\r\n- Added support for commands with spaces in their names for future command implementation.\r\n- Item->deepEquals() has been deprecated and its functionality added to Item->equals().\r\n- Added the Color class to the utils namespace. This was primarily added for use when reversing the encoding of the ClientboundMapItemDataPacket.\r\n- Player->hasPermission() will now throw an exception if the player has been closed.\r\n- Commands no longer all have the same hints if you modify one command's data.\r\n- API methods Player::isValidSkin() and Player::isValidName() have been added.\r\n- The API for Utils internet access has been improved, added BulkCurlTask for batch-executing cURL operations. See #834 for details.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay\r\n- Fixed sounds not working after 1.0.4\r\n- Added resource packs support. This support is currently very basic and will be improved in the future. Currently only resource packs in the .zip format are supported. See the resource packs configuration for details (will be created in the resource_packs/ directory after you run the server).\r\n- Hunger now works!\r\n- Implemented Absorption effect\r\n- Fixed bows can't be fired after starting or stopping sprint.\r\n- Fixed solid blocks filtering their own light, fixes light saving for lit furnace, pumpkins and glowing obsidian.\r\n- Fixed unlit furnaces glowing in the dark.\r\n- Fixed lighting issues due to light changes in subchunks which were not being saved to disk.\r\n- Block light is now correctly updated when removing obstructions.\r\n- Fixed potion bubbles not working.\r\n- Added support for copying tile NBT onto items by ctrl+middle-clicking on Windows 10 Edition.\r\n- Fixed blocks sometimes glitching and reappearing when broken due to timing issues.\r\n- Fixed slowness being removed when trying to sprint\r\n- Fixed lots of issues with the hotbar, armor equipment and item equipment in creative (and caused some creative transaction bugs)\r\n- Fixed Cake recipe not showing up due to having multiple result items\r\n- Fence-gates now work properly\r\n- Spectator-mode players cannot break blocks anymore if the AdventureSettings flags were not set correctly.\r\n- Fixed some issues with entity spawn rotation due to a silly mistake in AddEntityPacket.\r\n",

This can be configured under the `debug` section in pocketmine.yml.\r\n\r\n## API\r\n- API version suffix for plugins is now non-case-sensitive.\r\n- Type-hints have been added to Item::get() and some Item API methods. This is in an effort to combat some peculiar issues which arose from using null or wrong types.\r\n- Added API to allow customising randomly-ticked blocks in Level.\r\n- Added method `Level->isClosed()` to allow checking if a Level is still usable before trying to do stuff with it.\r\n- `Position->getLevel()` will now verify that the Level is usable before returning it, and if it is not will destroy the reference and return null. This is to help identify leaks with unloaded Levels.\r\n- Added API methods to allow controlling anti-cheat configuration per-player (#287) and added PlayerIllegalMoveEvent to allow plugins to cancel movement anti-cheat positives.\r\n- Removed deprecated `Utils::getRandomBytes()` (use php7 random_bytes() instead) (085d1a1)\r\n- Moved LevelException, PluginException and ChunkException into more relevant namespaces (946d301)\r\n\r\n# Fixes\r\n- Fixed CommandReader hanging on shutdown on Windows (#171)\r\n- Fixed vanilla McRegion worlds getting corrupted (8902992)\r\n- Fixed total server freeze when teleporting long distances\r\n- Fixed anti-cheat false-positives when climbing ladders and a wide variety of other movement issues (8ea0352)\r\n- Fixed shutdown memory leaks related to double chests (e4aa3d7)\r\n- Fixed eating golden apples with full hunger\r\n- Fixed long-string NBT encoding (longer than 127 bytes, length is a uvarint not a byte), fixed corrupted sign issues, fixed issues with unicode sign text\r\n- Fixed players appearing under the world when sleeping.\r\n- Fixed players continuing to burn in creative mode.\r\n- Fixed players sometimes not dying properly after taking lethal damage due to food regeneration (441961b)\r\n- Fixed a logic error in the basic generator preventing swamp biomes from generating (b566c4e)\r\n- Fixed setting item custom name doesn't update player (0584681)\r\n- Fixed bad lighting issues when importing a PocketMine-MP world back to vanilla Minecraft (946d301)\r\n",

    "body": "**For Minecraft PE 0.16.0.5 alpha**\n\n**THIS IS A PRE RELEASE. Do not use it in production unless you are sure you know what you are doing.**\n\nOnly changes since the 1.6dev tag will be documented here. Changes between 1.4.1 and 1.6dev are far too extensive to document effectively.\n\n# Changes\n\n## Core\n- New RNG, based on XorShift128 from the php-random library. This fixes issue with repeating terrain on 32-bit systems. _Note however that new generation into existing worlds will not be seamless._\n- Block and Item IDs have been moved to interfaces for better consistency\n- Better method for synchronisation of client/server time (less packet spam)\n- Utils::getRandomBytes() has been deprecated in favour of php7's random_bytes() function.\n- `<player>.dat` saving/reading can now be disabled in `pocketmine.yml` (set `player.save-player-data` to `false`)\n\n## Gameplay/game features\n- Added Flower Pots\n- Containers can now be opened in creative\n- Trapdoors can now be placed without a supporting block\n\n## API\n\nThis release has API changes, bumping the version to 2.1.0.\n\n### Entity metadata (0.16)\n\nMany changes have been made to entity metadata. Many true/false data properties are now entity status flags, such as NoAI, NametagVisible and various others. Entity status flags can be set using:\n`$entity->setDataFlag(Entity::DATA_FLAGS, Entity::INSERT_DATA_FLAG_NAME, true/false);`\n\n**Breaking** changes are detailed here. Additions are not documented. https://gist.github.com/dktapps/76b291b7a861762b54f7a8b834389883\n\n**NOTE: It's strongly recommended to use provided API methods where possible instead of tampering with metadata directly.**\n\n### AsyncTask API additions\n- Main thread local storage: Developers can pass any data including objects to the constructor of AsyncTask such that the data can be retrieved after the AsyncTask completes using the new `AsyncTask::fetchLocal()` method, or use the `AsyncTask::peekLocal()` method to get the data without removing it.\n- Progress updates: Developers can use the new `AsyncTask::publishProgress() method and override`AsyncTask::onProgressUpdated()` to handle AsyncTask progress information in the main thread.\n\nRefer to #1 and #100 for details.\n\n### WeakPosition\n\nWeakPosition was added in 1.6.1 to fix bugs with unloading levels which have player spawn points set in them. This type of position holds a level ID instead of a direct reference. Use this when your position may outlive the level it is in.\n\n### Removal of Item/NBT circular dependency\n\nRefer to #121 for details.\n\n### Other\n- Added Player->sendWhisper() (#73).\n- Removed LargeExplodeParticle due to incorrect name - use HugeExplodeParticle. Added HugeExplodeSeedParticle and BlockForceFieldParticle (7314aaf7f7bdae582f674c085c7ae879985bf847)\n\n# Fixes\n- Fixed the infamous hotbar spaz bug\n- Creative/spectator inventory now sends correctly\n- Fixed spectator flight controls\n- Fixed issues with items going past the end of the regular inventory\n- Fixed furnace client crashes\n- Fixed inventory windows for anvils and enchanting tables\n- Fixed kicked for walking on lily pads (#blameshoghicp)\n- Fixed a nasty entity-related memory leak on chunk unload\n- Fixed sleeping players floating above beds and teleportation of sleeping players.\n- Fixed a bug in Level::updateAround() where only one block would update\n- Fixed some slab placement issues (#31)\n- Fixed crash loading 1.11 worlds (#32)\n- Fixed broken `--disable-readline` command-line option (#34)\n- Fixed world unload crash when players have spawnpoints set in that world (#24)\n- Fixed start.sh detection of system PHP binaries (#66)\n- Fixed anvil rotation when placed and variant drops (d696049a0ad5e3b878a8f902e4ef75f19ec8cecc)\n- /timings command is now more verbose about paste errors (#95)\n- Fixed server crash at shutdown when RCON is enabled (#101)\n- Fixed server name is always \"Minecraft: PE Server\" when running setup wizard (92bd1a755d4b171b687538db83893b9bd9c70420)\n- Fixed CraftItemEvent->getInput() does not return used items (7eb9530346e953d1555623ff871086f85447b6c6)\n- Fixed useless ServerKiller (#122)\n",

    "body": "**For Minecraft: PE v0.9.5 alpha**\n\nThis is the fourth beta for 1.4. From now on, beta builds will be released faster with less changes between them, So we'll focus on adding new features on each build. New features will be buggy, but we hope to receive feedback to fix them soon. Old features will be more stable on each build.\n\nThis beta changes the API version to 1.3.0 (backwards-compatible), improving level chunk sending and adding new plugin events for developers. All plugins that target older APIs are compatible and do not need changes. If your plugin works on older API versions, please do not set the API version to 1.2.0, that will only refuse to load where it can work.\n\n**Main features:**\n- Improved player movement\n- Fixed player actions lagging behind the server\n- Implemented circular chunk sending / view distance\n- Generation works correctly with multiple worlds\n- Creative and survival hotbar works better\n- Better wooden tool crafting\n- Players will drop their inventory on death\n\n**Fixes and additions:**\n- Level formats can send chunks to players directly without implementing an AsyncTask\n- Implemented circular chunk sending / view distance, as Johan commented on the IRC\n- Fixed AddMobPacket (x,y,z from float to int)\n- Generated levels create chunks starting from the spawn, instead of the corner\n- Added exception handling to level loading\n- Player movement is sent as direct packets, decreases lag\n- Fixed #1883 Release strong weak references on close\n- Throw exception when null chunk is passed to a Tile/Entity instead of crashing\n- Fixed crash caused by a race condition on Query\n- Throw invalid event exception when a plugin tries to declare an abstract event\n- Stop submission of plugin syntax error crashes\n- Fixed crash on tile unloading\n- Load later plugins with custom loader, fixes API\n- Fixed #1882 Race-condition on multiple world generation, causing lock up\n- Alternate chunk generation between multiple levels\n- Fixed #1901, EmptyChunkSection gets replaced by invalid Section\n- Added SignChangeEvent\n- Added RemoteServerCommandEvent\n- Bump API version to 1.3.0\n- Removed PHP_VERSION constant on pocketmine namespace\n- Added Chiseled stone brick, red sand\n- Added item activation\n- Added Zombie spawn egg\n- Added Villager spawn egg\n- Fixed AddEntityPacket (type byte -> int)\n- Added base Arrow\n- Check if player is online before showing it to other players\n- Creative and survival hotbar works better\n- Workaround crash when placing paintings\n- Fixed crashes when default level is not loaded\n- Modified chunk generation garbage collector\n- Fixed #1674 Wooden tools only craft with Oak wood\n- Fixed #1889 Players drop their inventory when they die\n- Fixed #1703 In-game action lag\n- Fixed level data not being saved\n- Improved server shutdown\n- Improved player spawning, closes #1890\n- Added End Stone, End Portal, Mycelium, Monster Spawner and Podzol blocks.\n\n**Not implemented or known issues:**\nPlease do not report lacking features to the bug tracker, only report bugs on implemented features.\n- World generation is slower than in older builds\n- Server can use more memory than specified\n- Chunks are not freed correctly from the generation thread\n- Spawning lots of entities causes massive lag\n- Entities / Entity AI\n- No liquid flow\n- No support for LevelDB worlds (0.9.0 format)\n- No conversion for old levels (will be added later)\n- No Minecarts\n- Not all items are implemented\n- Generated worlds use a basic generator\n",

Old features will be more stable on each build.\n\nThis beta changes the API version to 1.3.0 (backwards-compatible), improving level chunk sending and adding new plugin events for developers. All plugins that target older APIs are compatible and do not need changes. If your plugin works on older API versions, please do not set the API version to 1.2.0, that will only refuse to load where it can work.\n\n**Main features:**\n- Improved player movement\n- Fixed player actions lagging behind the server\n- Implemented circular chunk sending / view distance\n- Generation works correctly with multiple worlds\n- Creative and survival hotbar works better\n- Better wooden tool crafting\n- Players will drop their inventory on death\n\n**Fixes and additions:**\n- Level formats can send chunks to players directly without implementing an AsyncTask\n- Implemented circular chunk sending / view distance, as Johan commented on the IRC\n- Fixed AddMobPacket (x,y,z from float to int)\n- Generated levels create chunks starting from the spawn, instead of the corner\n- Added exception handling to level loading\n- Player movement is sent as direct packets, decreases lag\n- Fixed #1883 Release strong weak references on close\n- Throw exception when null chunk is passed to a Tile/Entity instead of crashing\n- Fixed crash caused by a race condition on Query\n- Throw invalid event exception when a plugin tries to declare an abstract event\n- Stop submission of plugin syntax error crashes\n- Fixed crash on tile unloading\n- Load later plugins with custom loader, fixes API\n- Fixed #1882 Race-condition on multiple world generation, causing lock up\n- Alternate chunk generation between multiple levels\n- Fixed #1901, EmptyChunkSection gets replaced by invalid Section\n- Added SignChangeEvent\n- Added RemoteServerCommandEvent\n- Bump API version to 1.3.0\n- Removed PHP_VERSION constant on pocketmine namespace\n- Added Chiseled stone brick, red sand\n- Added item activation\n- Added Zombie spawn egg\n- Added Villager spawn egg\n- Fixed AddEntityPacket (type byte -> int)\n- Added base Arrow\n- Check if player is online before showing it to other players\n- Creative and survival hotbar works better\n- Workaround crash when placing paintings\n- Fixed crashes when default level is not loaded\n- Modified chunk generation garbage collector\n- Fixed #1674 Wooden tools only craft with Oak wood\n- Fixed #1889 Players drop their inventory when they die\n- Fixed #1703 In-game action lag\n- Fixed level data not being saved\n- Improved server shutdown\n- Improved player spawning, closes #1890\n- Added End Stone, End Portal, Mycelium, Monster Spawner and Podzol blocks.\n\n**Not implemented or known issues:**\nPlease do not report lacking features to the bug tracker, only report bugs on implemented features.\n- World generation is slower than in older builds\n- Server can use more memory than specified\n- Chunks are not freed correctly from the generation thread\n- Spawning lots of entities causes massive lag\n- Entities / Entity AI\n- No liquid flow\n- No support for LevelDB worlds (0.9.0 format)\n- No conversion for old levels (will be added later)\n- No Minecarts\n- Not all items are implemented\n- Generated worlds use a basic generator\n",
